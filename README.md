Hello! I'm glad you're interested in having a look at my project. Here are the steps to view it on your local machine:

Click on the [<> Code] button.

After clicking on [<> Code], you will see options like:
a. Clone
b. Open with GitHub Desktop
c. Download ZIP

Click on Download ZIPâ€”this is the easiest way to view the project.

Once the ZIP file is downloaded, go to your downloads folder. You'll see a file named My_Projects_main. Right-click on it and select the Extract All option.

After extracting the ZIP file, you'll see the HTML, CSS, and IMAGES folders, along with the index.html file. Double-click on the index.html file to open my project in your local browser.

Hope these instructions are clear and that you can easily view my project. Feel free to use the source code for your own projects!
